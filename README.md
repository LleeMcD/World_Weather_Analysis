# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this project was to:
- Utilize Python application programming interface (API) to generate random coordinates of world cities.
- Retrieve, collect and clean weather data 
- Plot weather data
- Determine correlations 
- Use Google API to create heatmaps
- Create deliverables to:
  - Retrieve weather data
  - Create a customer travel destinations map
  - Create a travel itinerary map

Visualizations from the project are below for reference. 

Vacation Map - Displays a number of cities based on a random sampling of 2,000 coordinate pairs and a desired temperature input function. In this case, the desired current temperature range was between 80 and 85 degrees fahrenheit.
There are markers and pop-ups that include the hotel name, city name, coutnry acronym, current weather description and maximum temperature.

Travel Map - Displays the driving route between four selected cities that are somewhat close in proximity, with waypoint markers to denote stopping points between them.
